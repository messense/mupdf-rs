/// This function allocates a new device and returns a pointer to it if no error occured. For the
/// required structure of `T` check the example below. If an error occurs the pointer `errptr` points
/// to will be set to to a pointer pointing to the error and null returned from this function.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The caller must ensure `ctx` and `errptr` to be a valid pointers.
///
/// It must also ensure `T` to be a type that starts with `fz_device`. Memory will be allocated for
/// a new instance of `T`, but only the `fz_device` portion will be initialized. The rest is
/// currently being zero-initialized, but this might change in the future.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This is how a compliant `T` might look like. The `repr(C)` is necessary as `repr(Rust)` does
/// not guarantee stable field orderings.
///
/// ```rust
/// use mupdf_sys::fz_device;
///
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct MyDevice {
///     base: fz_device,
///     foo: u32,
/// }
/// ```
